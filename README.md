Also have the option to choose the radius of how far they're willing to search for a restaurant.

Once user's location is set, they can now find restaurants by clicking "Find A Place".

Each time they press "Find A Place" a new random restaurant will appear.

If user wants to view all their restaurants they found then they should click "Previous Places". There it will display all
the restaurants they search.
